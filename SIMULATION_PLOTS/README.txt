---> First, run 'AAA_DATA_GENERATE_for_PLOTS.m' to generate data for sample size 200 from the original simulation model

---> Second, run 'AAA_QUANTICO.m' for applying QUANTICO to the data and save the information from posterior inference

---> Third, and lastly, run 'AAA_FINAL_PLOTS.R' to plot to regenerate the plots in the main paper.
