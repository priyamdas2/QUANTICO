---> 'QUANTICO_COMP_TIME.m' is the main code which should be executed.


---> Computation time for QUANTICO Method can be measured for setting 

    1) desired number of Level 1 covariates
    2) desired number of sample size
    3) Number of Level 2 covariates is fixed

---> The code estimates 9 quantile levels in parallel.


---> The data used for this code is generated from the simulation study model considered in the main (QUANTICO) paper.
     The  computation  is  performed  in  MATLAB  2016b  ona machine with Intel(R) Core(TM)i5-4590 CPU @ 3.30GHz processor,
     16 GB RAM and64-bit operating System having 12 parallel computing cores.
 

---> Obtained computation times are noted down in the QUANTICO main paper (or supplementary material).
